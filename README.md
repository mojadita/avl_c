This library allows to manage treemaps from C code.  It supports different
key schemas.  User must support key ordering for strange key orderings.

It was written to show implementors the tree structure and inner workings,
so printing routines were added to print keys in a hierarchical fashion
(it uses UTF-8 encoding for the tree structure)  It was written for
academic purposes, but it works and is efficient, so don't hesitate to
use it as you want.

Some examples have been written also to illustrate the workings of the
library.

It can manage memory allocation for the keys or let the user to do it,
through a couple of callbacks to duplicate keys, destroy them and print.

Support for CRC checking has been added to prevent memory corruption.
It's use on production system is discouraged as it slows down the execution
times.

I think you'll enjoy using this library!
